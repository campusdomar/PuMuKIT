      - `flavour` is the name of the flavour of an Opencast track to be used as side by side track in PuMuKIT. Default value: composition/delivery.
   - `error_if_file_not_exist` throw an error if the track file doesn't exist or it is not accessible using the url mapping info. Default value: true.
   - `sync_series_with_opencast` If true, the PuMuKIT series will be syncronized against Opencast. Default value: false
   - `url_mappging` is a list of url-path mappging used to generate the side by side video. Mandatory if `generate_sbs` is set to true.
      - `url` is the internal URL of the Opencast Matterhorn installation, used by Matterhorn to locate services running on the instance and for inter-node communication in distributed setups involving more than one Matterhorn node (org.opencastproject.server.url).
      - `path` is the directory where the system will store its processed files (including temporary files). This directory should be persistent between reboots (i.e., not /tmp) (org.opencastproject.storage.dir).

## 2. Opencast Export to PuMuKIT Workflow

To automate the process to import your Opencast events to PuMuKIT, the best option is to include a post-mediapackage operation on your Opencast workflow.

In order to do this:

1. Create a new user with the "Access API" permission.
2. Include a post operation using the following format at the end of the Opencast workflows on which you want to publish videos to PuMuKIT:
You'll need to change some configuration values with those from your environment:
* url: Replace "pumukit-host" with the domain name of your PuMuKIT deployment
* auth.username: Replace "user_import" with the username from Step 1
* auth.password: Replace "password_import" with the password from Step 1
```
    <!-- Publish to PuMuKIT -->
    <operation
      id="post-mediapackage"
      max-attempts="2"
      exception-handler-workflow="ng-partial-error"
      description="Publishing to PuMuKIT">
      <configurations>
        <configuration key="url">https://pumukit-host/api/opencast/import_event</configuration>
        <configuration key="format">json</configuration>
        <configuration key="debug">no</configuration>
        <configuration key="mediapackage.type">search</configuration>
        <configuration key="auth.enabled">yes</configuration>
        <configuration key="auth.username">user_import</configuration>
        <configuration key="auth.password">password_import</configuration>
      </configurations>
    </operation>
```

## 3. Cron tool

List of PuMuKIT commands that must be configured with the cron tool.

### 2.1. Batch Import

The `pumukit:opencast:batchimport` console command allows to import all Opencast videos into PuMuKIT at once.
This command allows to import all videos with or without invert option to switch camera and screen positions.
This option can be given with the command line option `--invert` with values `1` as true and `0` as false,
or just use the `batchimport_inverted` parameter value.

The recommendation for its use is to configure the cron tool on the PuMuKIT system, to execute this command periodically.
All videos already imported will be skipped, adding the new Opencast recordings to PuMuKIT.

Configure cron to synchronize PuMuKIT with Opencast. To do that, you need to add one of the following commands to the crontab file,
whether you want to import all the videos imported or not. The first command will use the value of the `batchimport_inverted` parameter.

```
sudo crontab -e
```

The recommendation on a development environment is to run commands every minute.
The recommendation on a production environment is to run commands every day, e.g.: every day at time 23:40.

```
40 23 * * *     /usr/bin/php /var/www/pumukit2/app/console pumukit:opencast:batchimport --env=prod
40 23 * * *     /usr/bin/php /var/www/pumukit2/app/console pumukit:opencast:batchimport --env=prod -i 1
40 23 * * *     /usr/bin/php /var/www/pumukit2/app/console pumukit:opencast:batchimport --env=prod -i 0
```

### 2.2. Workflow Stop

The `pumukit:opencast:workflow:stop` console command allows to stop all Opencast succeeded workflows of
a removed media package.

If the `delete_archive_mediapackage` parameter is set to `false`, there is no need to add this command to
the crontab configuration as media packages won't be removed in Opencast.

If the `delete_archive_mediapackage` parameter is set to `true`, and you want to delete all Opencast
succeeded workflows of a removed media package, you must add this command to the crontab configuration.

Configure cron to execute this command periodically.

```
sudo crontab -e
```

The recommendation on a development environment is to run commands every minute.
The recommendation on a production environment is to run commands every day, e.g.: every day at time 23:40.

```
40 23 * * *     /usr/bin/php /var/www/pumukit2/app/console pumukit:opencast:workflow:stop --env=prod
```
